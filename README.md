# Minimax algorithm

The minimax algorithm is a decision rule used in artificial intelligence, game theory, and decision-making in general. It aims to minimize the potential loss in the worst-case scenario.

In a two-player zero-sum game, one player seeks to maximize their gain, while the other seeks to minimize it. The minimax algorithm involves recursively evaluating all possible future moves, alternating between maximizing the player's gain and minimizing the opponent's gain.

Thus, the player considers all the opponent's possible best responses to their strategies, and chooses the strategy that maximizes the minimum gain they can obtain against an opponent playing optimally.

This algorithm is particularly useful for analyzing the first player's decisions in combinatorial games, where each position is assigned an evaluation value. The goal of the first player is to maximize this evaluation, while the second player seeks to minimize it, hence the application of the minimax principle.

Although simple in principle, this algorithm is widely used in practice, especially for the analysis of games like chess, with various optimizations to improve its computational efficiency.
